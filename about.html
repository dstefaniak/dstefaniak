  I was born and raised on the southwest side of Chicago. I'm currently working in the technical field as a software quality engineer. I enjoy learning new things and being a problem solver.<br>
  Additionally, I have project management and customer service experience. I enjoy playing golf, basketball, hockey and softball in my free time. <br>
  I also enjoy traveling and exploring new restaurants with my wife.
